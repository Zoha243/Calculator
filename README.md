# Calculator Project with Custom Multiplication and Division
This Python project implements a command-line calculator using functions for various mathematical operations. Notably, the multiplication and division operations are achieved without using the direct * and / operators. Instead, custom functions for multiplication and division have been created.

## Project Overview
### Mathematical Operations
#### Addition (Calculator_sum):

- Accepts two numbers as input.
- Returns the sum of the two numbers.
#### Subtraction (calculator_Subtract):
- Accepts two numbers as input.
- Returns the result of subtracting the second number from the first.
#### Multiplication (calculator_multiplication):

- Accepts two numbers as input.
- Implements multiplication using repeated addition.
- Returns the product of the two numbers.
#### Division (calculator_division):

- Accepts two numbers as input (dividend and divisor).
- Implements division without using the direct division operator.
- Returns the result of the division as a string.
#### Factorial (calculator_factorial):

- Accepts a number as input.
- Calculates the factorial of the input using a loop.
- Returns the factorial value.
#### Square Root (calculator_square_root):
- Accepts a number as input.
- Determines the square root using a loop.
- Prints the square root or indicates if it's not a perfect square.
### Custom Multiplication and Division Logic
#### Custom Multiplication (calculator_multiplication):
The multiplication function utilizes a loop to perform repeated addition, simulating the process of multiplication without using the direct * operator.

#### Custom Division (calculator_division):
The division function employs a custom logic involving loops and string manipulation to simulate the division process without using the direct / operator. It returns the result as a string.

### User Interaction
1. The user is presented with a menu to choose the desired operation.<br/>
2. Input is obtained from the user based on their chosen operation.<br/>
3. The result is displayed for each operation.<br/>
### Continuous Execution
The program is designed to run continuously, allowing the user to perform multiple calculations without restarting.
### How to Run the Calculator
- Open a Python environment or any Python-supported editor.<br/>
- Download the provided code.<br/>
- Run the script.<br/>
- Follow the on-screen prompts to choose the operation and input values.<br/>
### Additional Notes
- The calculator's unique feature is the custom implementation of multiplication and division without using the direct * and / operators.<br/>
- The use of functions enhances code modularity and readability.<br/>
